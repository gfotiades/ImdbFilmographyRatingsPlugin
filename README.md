# IMDB.com Actor/Actress Filmography Ratings Chrome Plugin
Chrome plugin for IMDB.com to show movie/show ratings on an actor or actress's filmography page.
Useful for finding good movies/shows your favorite actor or actress played in. Quite surprising that IMDB hasn't included this functionality by default. Created this because I myself wanted it, not because I'm trying to start some big project, just needed something simple to tweak that page, so I figured I'd throw it up here just in case anybody else does. Feel free to file an isuse or PR if something doesn't work, but I wouldn't expect active feature development on this project otherwise.

Not listed on Chrome app store, for now need to load as unpacked extension.  I'll get around to that ...
